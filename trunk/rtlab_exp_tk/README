This is the beginnings of our real-time experiment interface toolkit.

BEFORE YOU COMPILE
------------------

Currently the makefiles build the "daq_system" application.  In order to get
this to compile properly you must do the following:

1. Make sure you have a Realtime Linux variant.  Either RT-Linux
   (http://www.fsmlabs.com) v 3.1 or RTAI 24.1.9 (http://www.rtai.org)
   needs to be installed.  Earlier versions should probably work too, 
   but your mileage may vary.

2. Make sure Comedi 0.7.65 or later (earlier ones may work too) with comedilib
   and kcomedilib are installed (http://www.comedi.org/comedi).

3. Make sure Qt 3.0.1 is installed.  Earlier versions may work or they may not.
   Be sure you know WHERE Qt is installed as the configure script asks you for
   this information.


Next, you must run the following command from WITHIN the source tree to
configure the build system:

	./configure

Follow the on-screen prompts and input the required information.  If you
correctly installed comedi, kcomedilib, RTAI/RTLinux, and you have a valid
kernel source tree, everything should build just fine.

COMPILING
---------
Now that the above is done, type 'make' and hope for the best.  The binary that
will be built will be "daq_system" which is the user-level program data
acquisition.  Two kernel modules will also be built: rtlab.o and avn_stim.o.


NOTE ABOUT COMPILERS:

For best results, you should use GNU g++-2.96 as the C++ compiler.  If for 
some reason all your C++ libraries were compiled with another C++ compiler
(such as g++ 3.0), then use that.  Unfortunately the C++ Binary Interface has
changed a lot over the years, and so C++ object files and libraries are very
sensitive to compiler versions.

The regular C compiler doesn't matter too much, but you may have trouble with 
gcc-2.96 when building against RTAI.  (Since RTAI requires gcc 2.95).  

Note that some people that use RTAI need to mix their gcc and g++ versions, 
since g++-2.95 is not 100% supported by RTLab (but gcc-2.95 is required by
RTAI!!).  If you want to use RTLab with RTAI, and you are having compiling
problems or random program crashes, you should try using g++ 2.96 and 
gcc 2.95.  

(On the other hand, with RTLinux you should be fine using version 2.96 of both
 g++ and gcc.)

If you end up using g++-2.95 as the C++ compiler, you may get weird SIGABRT 
program terminations.  This is due to some strange behavior with respect to 
exceptions and how they propagate through different dynamically linked objects.
(I *think*).


RUNNING
-------
In order for this sample program to even run, you need to insmod the real-time
part of this application, "rlab.o", which is also built into the current
directory.  Before rlab.o will work, however, you have to make sure the
following criteria are met:

1) You have the following modules installed:

	- RTLinux

			kcomedilib, comedi, mbuff, rtl_fifo, rtl_sched, rtl_posixio, 
            rtl_time, rtl

	- RTAI
			rtai rtai_sched rtai_pthread rtai_fifos rtai_shm comedi kcomedilib


2) Also make sure your comedi device is /dev/comedi0 and that its driver is
loaded and correctly configured/working.


COMING SOON
-----------
More in the way of an actual toolkit.  Including documentation, more C++ 
classes and templates, and more development to the core architecture. Also more
applications will be built as reference implementations of software that uses
the toolkit.


Please come back to http://www.rtlab.org soon to check for changes.  Also if 
you are interested in updates, please suubscribe to the mailing list.  We 
hope this software will grow very much in the coming months!
