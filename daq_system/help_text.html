This RT-Linux based system can be used for acquisition of up to 8 channels.

<p><a name=\"config\"></a>A <i>configuration window</i> appears upon program initialization. It allows you to select: (i) the number of channels to display and acquire, (ii) the number of seconds of data to display, and (iii) whether or not to show the spike indicator.
<p><a name=\"ascii_bin\"></a>The <i>ascii/binary buttons</i> allow you to choose whether to record to a binary or ascii file. Binary data requires less disk storage space (but also requires an interpreter program or knowledge of the data structure). Ascii data is space delimited.
<p><a name=\"recording\"></a>Click on the <i>Recording</i> button to start or stop recording. When recording is active the data is being saved to disk. When recording is inactive the data is displayed, but not saved to disk.
<P><a name=\"channels\"></a>Use the <i>channel pulldown menu</i>, located below the ascii/bin buttons, to choose which channel's controls are displayed. You may then modify the properties for that channel. 
<p><a name=\"pause\"></a>Click the <i>pause all</i> button to pause plotting for all channels, or the <i>CH</i> button to pause the selected channel only. Note that only the data display is paused - acquisition and recording (if active) are unaffected by the pause. 
<p><a name=\"log\"></a>The <i>log</i> allows you to conviniently save information about the recording into a text file. Enter text into the editor and click the \"Save\" button to write to a file. Every time this button is clicked the filename.log is rewritten to disk.To enter the current timer value into the log file, place the cursor at the desired position and click \"Time\".

<p>
<p><a name=\"spike\"></a><b>Spike Indicator Controls</b>
<br>Use the <i>threshold scroller</i> adjust spike threshold (horizontal green dotted line). A spike is detected when the voltage crosses this line in the upward direction for positive polarity or downward direction for negative polarity.
<br>The <i>blanking scroller</i> can be used to adjust spike blanking (gray horizontal bar in upper left corner of plot). Spike detection is inactivated for the time duration equivalent to the blanking bar length after each detected spike.
<br>Use the <i>gain pulldown menu</i> to adjust voltage displayed on the y-axis and the scan resolution of the data acquisition board for the active channel. The complete DAQ board resolution (e.g., 12 or 16 bits) is used for the displayed axis range. This does not affect the signal amplification.
<br>The <i>polarity buttons</i> toggle spike polarity. Spikes are detected when the voltage crosses the green threshold line in the upward direction for positive polarity, and downward direction for negative polarity.
<br>The spike indicator displays the time interval (in ms) between the two most recently detected spikes (the inter-spike interval).
