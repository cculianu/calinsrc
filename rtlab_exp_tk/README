This is the beginnings of our real-time experiment interface toolkit.

BEFORE YOU COMPILE
------------------

Currently the makefiles build the "daq_system" application.  In order to get
this to compile properly you must do the following:

0. Make sure RT-Linux (http://www.rtlinux.com) v 3.1 is installed.  Earlier versions should probably work too, but your mileage may vary.

1. Make sure Comedi 0.7.60 or later (earlier ones may work too) with comedilib and kcomedilib are installed.

2. Make sure Qt 3.0.1 is installed.  Earlier versions may work or they may not.  I have tried Qt 2.3.0 and it seemed to work as well, but I am not actively making a promise it will continue to work in the future.  Make sure the environment variable QTDIR is set before you run 'make' and that it points to your Qt installed directory. (On Redhat it has been known to be /usr/lib/qt-2.3.0/ or /usr/lib/qt2 or maybe /usr/lib/qt-3.0.1 if you are already on Qt3).

3. Make sure you also installed tmake.  The rpm for tmake is available from http://www.trolltech.com and also http://www.rpmfind.net.  This tmake utility is a great make-helper written in Perl.  It really made our lives easier and I recommend it highly!


Next, you must edit the following files:

1. Edit Makefile.tmake and change the RTL_MK = line to point to the place where your rtl.mk file is.  This file was generated when you installed and compiled RT-Linux.

2. Edit Makefile.rt_process and modify the line that begins with COMEDI_DEVEL_HEADERS=.  These are the headers that go with comedi.  They are kernel headers for kcomedilib stuff and don't get installed in the usual /usr/include. Please point this define to your comedi source directory in the include/ subdirectory.

For example, 

COMEDI_DEVEL_HEADERS = /usr/src/comedi/include

would be one possible place you put these headers.  Actually since comedi doesn't do it for you, you can put the headers anywhere you want.


COMPILING
---------
Now that the above is done, type 'make' and hope for the best.  The binary that will be built will be "daq_system" which is the user-level program for just displaying some graphs that come from your DAQ board.  


RUNNING
-------
In order for this sample program to even run, you need to insmod the real-time part of this application, "rt_process.o", which is also built into the current directory.  Before rt_process.o will work, however, you have to make sure the following criteria are met:

1) You have the following modules installed:
	kcomedilib, mbuff, rtl_fifo, rtl_sched, rtl_posixio, rtl_time, comedi, rtl

2) Also make sure your comedi device is /dev/comedi0 and that its driver is loaded and working.


COMING SOON
-----------
More in the way of an actual toolkit.  Including documentation, more C++ classes and templates, and more development to the core architecture. Also more applications will be built as reference implementations of software that uses the toolkit.


Please come back to http://www.rtlab.org soon to check for changes.  Also if you are interested in updates, please email me and I may get around to creating a mailing list for this software.  We hope this software will grow very much in the coming months!
